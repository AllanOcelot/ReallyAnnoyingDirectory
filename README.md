# ReallyAnnoyingDirectory - Introduction Project

A directory of really 'awful' front-end pages. No Style guide requirements. Template Provided. Write as much or as little as you want. 

## Purpose 

What we're doing here is giving everyone regardless of skill level a chance to contribute to a repository without being terrified of things like styleguides, making people mad (it's kind of the point), and all the other things that come with big scary things like trying to make stuff with people you've never met who definintely probably maybe know more than you. 

In other words, It's designed to be difficult to fuck this up from a new person's perspective. While being 'fun' for everyone.

## Getting Started

Suggested Reading for those new to github: 
[Are You Completely New?](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

[Are you Sort of new?](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

The template folder contains a basic page's requirements.

## Contributing Requirements

* There is no required style guide to be enforced for only this project except what is below
* All new pages must have a non-default name
* All new pages must link back to the directory.
* All new pages must be added in the subDirectory folder.
* No modifications to the directory page are allowed **EXCEPT** adding a link to your page.
* The anchor back to the directory **must not be impossible to reach**, but you can make it hard to get.
* In the description of the pull request detail what it is your page does that is annoying.
* Only 1 page may be added, but you can go back and update your original page later if you choose to (No external style sheets but CDNs are fine)

## MANDATORY RULES

* Partial secrets/Surprises/are acceptable but **nothing** that's NSFW / Screamers / Tubgirl-Lemonparty-esque
* We're having fun screwing around here not trying to brick people's computers / cause damage.

## Guidelines

* Creativity is heavily endorsed, make it as complicated or as simple as you want / are able to.
* Memes are endorsed
* You can use a CDN to bring in frameworks.
